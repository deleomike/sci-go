This library has been developed with an idiomatic design process, and inspiration from a few sources.

## Installing

Sci-Go currently has no non-stdlib dependencies, so installing it and getting started is rather easy.

```bash
go get -u deleomike/sci-go
```

## Usage

There are a lot of things in the [works](https://github.com/deleomike/sci-go/issues/1), but right now we have these feature sets implemented.
